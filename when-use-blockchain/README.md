### Understanding when to use blockchain is an important skill for any developer!

Why? 

### My expectations on when blockchain will be useful:
My expectation: the problem of 'When' is to discern situations blochchains are most applicable by comparing other technologies. Therefore I need to review blockchain's pros and cons, e.g. its unique characteristics and its domain of applicability.

The wordcloud here show my perception of blockchain's pros and cons:

- security, safety, scalability
- censorship, privacy, anonymity
- truth validation, authorship, transaction validation
- trust(less), middleman, permissionless
- immutable, transparent
- distributed, decentralized


Q: what is blockchain anyway? (mental picture)

A: Blockchain is about 
- chain: sequential/chronlogical legders/transactions which are immutable.
- net: decentralized networks where nodes are connected to each other, but not controled by any one node.
- eco: trustless economics which is based on consensus and permissionless.

Q: What make blockchain unique, comparing with existing systems (ledge, centralized network, middle man economics) 

- physical scarcity (gold, dollar bill) vs digital scarcity (NFT, crypto token)

- from hundreds of individual tokens (Bitcoin,...) to a platform (Ethereum)

Q: What are the milestone blockchain become the mainstream
- from infrastructure/core to UI

- from incentive to create fake news to re-programmable incentive to verify true news


- efficiency and transparency on transmitting secure/private info

Q: Would blockchain replace internet (2)? Why and when

### Review: Are my expectations of blockchain correct?

### Cryptographic mechanisms <-> features
**Identity**
- public|private key cryptography: allow verifiable transaction ==> **permissionless, anonymous**

**Transactions**
- Merkel trees & Hash pointers: allow immutable storage of transactions ==> **immuntable, transparent**
- Merkel Patricia Trees & State (Solidity programming language)
**Shared Database**
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance and proof of work: allow consensus among nodes & prevent transaction reversal ==> **trustless, censorship resistant**

### history of digital values
**2010s**
- Mastercoin (2013) - Omni
- Ethereum (2015) - Vitalik Buterin
- ICO Spring (2017) - Telegram Network, Cryto Kitties, Bancor, Tezos, Sirin, NEO, XRP


### Web3 breakdown
```python
web3 = {'transactionary ledger':{'single asset':['bitcoin',], 'smart contract': [Ethereum,]}, 'identity':'keystore mgmt', 'storage':{'proxy privacy tech':[Nucypher,], 'data structure': []}
```

### Web3 as a secure social operating system
Q: what motivate zero-trust, social-technical systems?
A: privacy + data hack + data monetization (FB, GGL)

Q: what kind of need web3 fulfill?
A: the piramy of human needs (view: why you leave your previous job|join a new company?)

[] Top1: self-actualization: achieving one's full potential including creative activities,

[] Top2: Esteem needs: prestige and feeling of accomplishment

[] Top3: Belonging & Love: intimate relationship and friendship

[v] Top4: Safty: security and safety

[v] Top5: Physiological needs: food, water, warmth, rest

### What is finance?
word_cloud = {debt, payments, loans, market, stocks, insurance, forex, swaps, currency, settlement, derivatives, futures, trading, analytics, mortgages, factoring, margin,...}

### What makes DiFi distinguish from traditional Fi?
- censorship resistance
- programmable assets
- pseudonym
- transparent and trustless
- permissionless

DiFi, Decentralized Finance, is a movement that leverages decentralized networks to transform tradictional finance products into trustless, transparent **protocols** that run without intermediates.


## Q2. What are the building blocks of DiFi making it so powerful and popular?

1. Stablecoins

- what is stable coin: the cryptocurrencies created to decrease the voltality of cypto price w.r.t. some 'stable' asset or basket of assets. A stable coint can be pegged to currency (e.g. USD) or exchange-traded commodities (e.g. gold).
- What are types of stablecoins?
    - Asset-backed: DIGIX (gold backed)
    - Cryto-backed: Maker (bitcoin, Ethereum backed)
    - Fiat-backed: Coinbase (USD backed)

2. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)
- what is DEXs? is a currency exchange operating in a decentralized way, without central authority through smart contracts and oracles.
- What are types of DEXs?
    - non-custodial: AIRSWAP (75% dominance)
    - NO KYC: Uniswap
    - Aggregators: DEX.AG
    
3. Lending & Borrowing
- D-lending platform provides loans to individuals and business without middleman. DiFi lending enable everyone to earn interest on supplied stablecoins and cryptocurrencies.

- Types of lending platforms:
    - Non-custodial: Maker
    - CeFi: BlockFi
    - Borrow/Lend protocols: AAVE, Compound
    
4. Tokenization
- through tokenization, investing is cheaper, faster, more secure, available every hour every day.
- it open up a real worldwise assets and cryptocurrencies to all people access to the internet, disregard where they are and what financial restrictions they are under.

- Harbor
- Tokensoft
- Securitize
- Polymath

5. Synthetic Assets (Derivatives)
- a derivative is a contract that derives its value from the performance of its `underlying` (e.g. assets, index, interest rate)

- swap.rate, set TokenSets, Synthetix (95% dominance)

6. Asset Mgmt tools in DiFi
- traditional finance: specialized institution is responsible to saftguard individual or company's financial assets; they are NOT engaged in commercial banking or consumer/retail banking.
- DiFi: you are the only custodian of your funds and assets. But you can use DeFi apps to managing your cryptocurrencies and assets: Coinbase Wallet, Meta, InstaDapp, Argent, 

### Q3. How DiFi builds a global, permissionless alternative to EVERY financial service we have today?

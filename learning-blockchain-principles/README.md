### Game Theory

Q: What is Game theory?
A: the math on how A interact Bs under circustance C by taking action D with rewarding E.

Q: what Economic Game Theory seek to understand?
A: Why people make decisions.

Q: why game theory matters to blockchain?
A: it helps to design a system that encourage competition and social interaction among users.

### Consensus Mechanism

Q: What is consensus mechanism in Blockchain?
A: to reach agreement among distributed actors so that even one node goes wrong, the rest of the network perform as expected; consensus mechanism can NOT enforce everyone to follow the agreement.
Q: Why it matters?

Q: How do different blockchains implement each of its consensus mechanism? What are the best industrial practices?

### Consistency and Permanence
Q: what is consistency? what is permanence? Do they have a linear relationship or nonlinear one?
A: What if all the trees in the world decide not to consume CO2 and produce O2? What if the law of gravity stop working? You can see that consistency is a necessary principle for a 'good' system to work. 

Without consistency, people would not trust a system like Bitcoin and will move to another one has consistency built in.

Randomness & consistency are not exclusive, they can co-exist in the same system. Think about a the O2 a tree produce every second, there is consistency and there is also randomness in it. Randomness VS deterministic are relative too: the result of a sampling experiment is random, but the distribution of sampling is deterministic (and thus consistent!)

Permanence means that the rule/principle of a system persist for a period of time long enough so that the system can function as expected even under lots of unknow or attacks.

### Truth and Responsibility

Q: what is truth about the system, about the actors under the context of blockchain?
Truth is like mathematics!

Q: What is resposibility about the system, about the actors?

If a system is designed without taking responsibility in its core, it could pursue profit all the time all the means, ending up net negative to its enviroment, our next generation, other people, animals.

### Decentralization

Q: What does decentralization look like? 
- Napster is a file sharing platform that allow people to download music and other media for free. It hosted files on a centralized server, which was eventually shut down by goverment. And the owner of Snapter faced extreme legal consequences.

- BitTorrent (file storage and download)

Q: Why it matter? (what are the painpoints of a centralized system? What if we do not have decentralization?)
A: think about how to break control of a totalism-marfi goverment, who controls everything within its Great Wall; think about WallStreet, Hollywood, CIA, SocialMedia big tech.

### Scaling 

Example: Bitcoin mining

- The diffficulty of mining bitcoin is adjust every 2 week/ every 2016 blocks: when some big miner increase tons of computation power, the bitcoin increase the difficulty to mine a coin; when the total computation power are withdraw, the system decrease the difficulty so that any major swings of computation power will not break the network.

- you see that both scaling up and scaling down are both necessary for a system like bitcoin to work stably!

### Security

Bitcoin worths billions and is under constant hacks, however, Bitcoin has such a well designed security that it has NEVER been compromised or taken down. What?? Isn't there are reports that some digital wallets was stolen and can not be recovered? The accident was real but the reports was missed: what has been compromised is the 3rd party app, not the Bitcoin system itself.

### Userfriendliness
- even a system is extremely complex, but to interact with it is simple and intuitive. Just like gravity, it is a intricate law in any physical system. But a baby does not need to know $gravity = g*m1*m2*d^2$, when he sees how his parent walk, the baby mimic and makes it.

- If a system is not userfriendly, it lacks of responsibility! it lacks of security!

- Userfriendliness is tied to consistency: your system is not crashed due to unpredicted behaviors or users acting unexpectly.

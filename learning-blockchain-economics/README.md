## What give crytocurrency value?
**liquidity**: economics systems is created by money flow among nodes of demands & supplies
- cryto mining cost billions in 
    - electricity
    - mining infrastructure (computer, graph card, ...)
    - mining internet network

- new demand for innovation for machine & network by miners
- companies help people to secure currency storage and exchange.
- you can start paying your hotel, icecream by cryto

**legislative acceptance**
- when governments start tax cryto income,
- when big banks start acquiring cryto trading startups
- when non-sophesticated investors are allowed to participate trading cryto on public trading platforms

**network innovations** such as trustless-ness, decentralization, shelter fr. deflation

**supply & demand**: supply keep decreasing exponentially and demand keep growing exponentially

**human emotion & imagination (speculation)**

## Disruptive Innovations

### Network Innovations

**fund raising** from location fundraising (church, VC) to gofundme.com to ICO (initial coin offering)

**transfer money** old: going to a physical location (bank) to show tons of paperwork (with the risk of being reject) and spend days/weeks & spend 5 to 15 percent to transfer money from A to B; new: you can transfer money wherever you are, it does not require you to have any ID and paperwork, it takes from minutes to second, it takes couple cents.

**finance tracking** a public chain allow you to track every dollar you donated into charity and see where it goes. Not only charity will become fully visible and accountable in how their funds are used, but also others institutes including governments, banks, companies

### Hardware & Software innovation

**consensus mechanism** Underlining technology (code) that ensure the entire network to agree on and work toward common goal/task.

Example: allow people around the world to participate solving difficult problems such as protein folding.

ASCI (application-Specific Integrated Circuit) for mining (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit)

### Trade and commerce in new economics
ICO, STO and other types of fundraising open you up to **world-wide competition on investment**, which raise the bar for the quality of projects, at the same time allow more project to be funded.

Decentralized systems make it easy to you to find way to be compensated for your contribution/work, regardless where you live or what government you are under.

### Programmable money vs printed money
- decouple government and money will allow individual communities to have global currencies.
- accountability & visibility
- money supply response to people and market through customizable functions (code)
- No printing operation needed, can be easily and quickly established in communities (ET), helping people as sound means of transaction
